1.  <h1>Event Loop</h1>
The event loop is a programming concept used in asynchronous programming, particularly in JavaScript, that allows for non-blocking I/O operations. The event loop runs continuously, waiting for events to occur, and then processes those events one by one.

In simple terms, the event loop manages a queue of tasks, and when a task completes, it notifies the event loop, which then processes the next task in the queue. This allows for multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously, without blocking each other.
