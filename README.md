1.  <h3>The Event Loop</h3>
The event loop is a programming concept used in asynchronous programming(concurrent execution of multiple tasks ), particularly in JavaScript, that allows for non-blocking I/O operations. The event loop runs continuously, waiting for events to occur, and then processes those events one by one.

In simple terms, the event loop manages a queue of tasks such as user interactions, timers, and network requests, and when a task completes, it notifies the event loop, which then processes the next task in the queue. This allows for multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously, without blocking each other.

<h3>6 phases of the event loop</h3>
In JavaScript, the event loop consists of six phases, each of which performs a specific task in the processing of events. These phases are as follows:<br>
<br>

**Timers phase:** In this phase, the event loop checks for any timer callbacks that have completed, and adds them to the callback queue. That is if there are timers set to 0 ms or setImmediate(), they will run here. Incomplete timers will run in later iterations of the loop.

**I/O phase:** In this phase, the event loop checks for any I/O callbacks that have completed, such as network requests or file I/O, and adds them to the callback queue.

**Idle, Prepare phase:** In this phase, the event loop performs internal housekeeping tasks and prepares for the next iteration of the loop.

**Poll phase:** In this phase, the event loop retrieves new I/O events from the operating system's event queue and adds them to the callback queue. If there are no pending I/O events, the event loop will wait for new events to arrive.

**Check phase:** In this phase, the event loop executes any callbacks that are on the callback queue, as a result of timer or I/O events.

**Close phase:** In this final phase, the event loop executes any 'close' event callbacks, such as when a socket connection is closed.

Once all phases have been completed, the event loop returns to the first phase and begins tshe process again.
