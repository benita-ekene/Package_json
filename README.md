1.  <h3>The Event Loop</h3>
The event loop is a programming concept used in asynchronous programming(concurrent execution of multiple tasks ), particularly in JavaScript, that allows for non-blocking I/O operations. The event loop runs continuously, waiting for events to occur, and then processes those events one by one.

In simple terms, the event loop manages a queue of tasks such as user interactions, timers, and network requests, and when a task completes, it notifies the event loop, which then processes the next task in the queue. This allows for multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously, without blocking each other.

2.  <h3>Six phases of the event loop</h3>
In JavaScript, the event loop consists of six phases, each of which performs a specific task in the processing of events. These phases are as follows:<br>
<br>

**Timers phase:** In this phase, the event loop checks for any timer callbacks that have completed, and adds them to the callback queue. 

**I/O phase:** In this phase, the event loop checks for any I/O callbacks that have completed, such as network requests or file I/O, and adds them to the callback queue.

**Idle, Prepare phase:** In this phase, the event loop performs internal housekeeping tasks and prepares for the next iteration of the loop.

**Poll phase:** In this phase, the event loop retrieves new I/O events from the operating system's event queue and adds them to the callback queue. If there are no pending I/O events, the event loop will wait for new events to arrive.

**Check phase:** In this phase, the event loop executes any callbacks that are on the callback queue, as a result of timer or I/O events.

**Close phase:** In this final phase, the event loop executes any 'close' event callbacks, such as when a socket connection is closed.

Once all phases have been completed, the event loop returns to the first phase and begins tshe process again.

3.  <h3> List of some best practices in server-side code development</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus on Code Quality - use a formatter like Prettier and a linter like ESLint</li>
<li>Prefer ES6+ and Async/Await</li>
<li>Keep Code Small - Modularize your codes and employ Microservice architecture</li>
<li>Handle Errors</li>
</ul>

4.  <h3>What is NPM5: How do you initialize a package in npm</h3>

NPM5 (Node Package Manager 5) is a version of the Node.js package manager, which is used to install and manage third-party packages and dependencies for Node.js-based applications.
<ol type="roman numeral"> <h4>To initialize a package in NPM</h4>
<li>Open your terminal or command prompt.</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory where you want to create your package.</li>
<li>Type "npm init" and press Enter.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts to provide the required information about your package.</li>
<li>Once you've provided all the necessary information, review the package.json file that was created.</li>
<li>Save or edit and save package.json file</li>
</ol>

5.  <h3>How to run a script in the package.json</h3>

To run a script defined in the package.json file in a Node.js project, you can use the npm run command followed by the script name.<br>
<br>
//Here is an example package.json file with a script named student:
<br>
<br>
{<br>
  "name": "my-app",<br>
  "version": "1.0.0",<br>
  "scripts": {<br>
    "student": "node index.js"<br>
  }<br>
}<br>
<br>
//To run the student script, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the<br>
//project directory, and run the following command:
<br>
npm run student
